# CollaborativeStory
CollaborativeStory is a smart contract that enables multiple authors to co-write chapters of a narrative while automatically splitting any deposited funds based on each contributorâ€™s total number of chapters. It includes a built-in first chapter to kickstart the story and can be used on any EVM-compatible network (for example, the Odyssey Testnet).
